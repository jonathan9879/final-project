## Data Analysis Full Time Cohort - February 2019

### Overview
In an age where we give our data to companies in exchange of services, some questions come to mind: How much data do these companies truly have? Is it possible that they know more about us than ourselves? Is it ethical?

What this project tries to tackle are these questions and others. The data that will be analysed will be all the data that google regarding me. Complementary data may be added later if necessary, of which sources could be: Spotify API, Apple, Runkeeper, Sworkit, Samsung, Garmin, etc...

Some questions that appear after having chosen the data sources would be:
* Where do I often go to?
* What do I spend time on?
* What are my personal worries and dreams?
* What are my habits?
* What should be my alarm clock song?
* Who are my best friends?
* What do I spend money on?
* How much space do my photos take on the cloud? Will it grow in the future?

The main objectives of this project are:
* Takle an important data ethics concern/issue in regards to data privacy.
* Analyze my habits and find patterns.
* Visualise just how much data a company has about me.
* Understand me better
